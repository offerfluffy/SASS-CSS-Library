## üöÄ **Project Overview**

### **CSS Library Folder (Sass Project)** üßë‚Äçüíª

In this folder, you'll find  **Sass project** organized into clean and modular directories. The styles for your website are written in **Sass** (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), which is an extension of CSS that allows you to write more powerful, maintainable, and organized styles.

### **Project Structure** üìÇ

The **`/src`** folder is the heart of project, where all the Sass and compiled CSS files reside.

```
/src
  /css                 # Compiled and purged CSS files (e.g., style.min.css)
  /html                # HTML files for your website 
  /scss                # Sass source files (e.g., styles.scss)
    /abstract          # Sass abstract files (variables, mixins, etc.)
    /base              # Global styles like resets and typography
    /components        # Reusable components like buttons, forms, etc.
    /layouts           # Layouts for header, footer, etc.
    /themes            # Theme-related styles
    /utilities         # Utility classes (spacing, text styles, etc.)
  
/gulpfile.js           # Gulp configuration file
```

* **/scss**: This is where all source Sass files. It is further organized into subfolders:
